* SETTING UP DEV ENVIRONMENT *
- Create index.html + Folder 'build / js / script.js'
- NOTE: Modern JavaScript [ async | defer ]

/* async */
In other words, async scripts load in the background and run when ready. The DOM and other scripts don’t wait for them, and they don’t wait for anything. A fully independent script that runs when loaded. As simple, as it can get, right?

/* defer */
The defer attribute tells the browser not to wait for the script. Instead, the browser will continue to process the HTML, build DOM. The script loads “in the background”, and then runs when the DOM is fully built.

NOTE: Test JavaScript by opening your browser (edge, chrome, firefox etc) right click "inspect element" look for console tab.
